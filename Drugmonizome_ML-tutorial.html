        <h1>Navigating the Drugmonizome-ML Appyter</h1>
        <p style="padding: 10px">A wealth of data from a multitude of sources is readily available for thousands of bioactive small molecules. This information can be harnessed to develop machine learning models that utilize such data to predict the properties of small molecules that are poorly annotated. The Drugmonizome database draws upon a variety of publicly available resources to label each compound by its associations with pathways, protein targets, induced gene expression profiles, chemical features, and other attributes. Drugmonizome-ML is a machine learning platform built on top of the Drugmonizome datasets to predict novel indications and other attributes such as drug targets or side effects for bioactive small molecules. Drugmonizome-ML is an Appyter that executes a machine learning pipeline as a Jupyter notebook. To demonstrate Drugmonizome-ML, a case study is presented where we predict drugs and small molecules that may induce peripheral neuropathy as a side effect. Several of the predicted candidates were corroborated by independent published studies. Taken together, Drugmonizome-ML is a general-purpose machine learning platform that can be useful for tasks of predicting drug and small molecule attributes using rapidly accumulating pharmacological knowledge.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If selecting features from various data sources, it is likely that not all compounds will be included across all feature sets. Users have the option of keeping drugs with missing data or alternatively dropping these compounds from the feature matrix.</li>
            <li>Additionally, because some of the available feature sets are binary association matrices, users have the option of applying TF-IDF normalization to account for frequency of common and rare terms among the small molecules.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2>Target Label Selection</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px">In this section users select their positive class label for a binary classification problem. Users may opt to:</p>

        </ol>
        <p style="padding-left: 35px">Additionally, the <b>Include stereoisomers</b> option gives users the ability to choose whether to match compounds from the feature vector to the target vector using the first 14 characters of the InChI Key (which encodes chemical connectivity) thus including stereoisomers of a particular small molecule, or whether to consider only one form of a molecule and match by the whole InChI Key.</p>
